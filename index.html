<h1>TradeFlow Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="effective">Effective Date: 18 February 2026</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
TradeFlow is a Chrome extension that overlays a trading execution checklist on charting websites.
It is designed with a <strong>local-first</strong> approach: your data stays on your device.
TradeFlow does not collect analytics, telemetry, or tracking data of any kind.
</p>

<h2>2. Data Stored Locally</h2>
<p>
All user-created content is stored on your device using Chrome's <strong>storage.local</strong> API.
This includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Checklist templates, progress, and saved checklists</li>
  <li>Trade journal entries, execution tags, and notes</li>
  <li>Risk calculator settings and instrument profiles</li>
  <li>Drawing tool preferences and UI settings</li>
  <li>Theme selection and overlay position</li>
  <li>Premium entitlement flags (Pro/Founder status)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This data is never transmitted to any server. It remains entirely on your device and under your control.
</p>

<h2>3. Authentication &amp; Billing</h2>
<p>
If you choose to subscribe to TradeFlow Pro, the extension communicates with
<strong>tradeflow-biller.vercel.app</strong> for the following purposes only:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Magic-link authentication:</strong> You provide your email address on the billing site to receive a sign-in link. The email is processed by our billing server and is not stored in the extension.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription verification:</strong> The extension periodically checks your entitlement status (active/inactive, plan type, renewal date). These requests include a session token but no other personal data.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment processing:</strong> All payments are handled by <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank">Stripe</a>. The extension never collects, processes, or stores credit card numbers or financial account details.</li>
</ul>
<p>
No data from these requests is used for tracking, analytics, or advertising.
</p>

<h2>4. External API Requests</h2>
<p>
TradeFlow makes optional requests to <strong>api.frankfurter.app</strong>, a free and open-source
foreign exchange rate API, to retrieve live currency prices for the risk calculator.
These requests contain only the currency pair being queried and do not include any personal information.
</p>

<h2>5. Screenshot Capture</h2>
<p>
When you use the screenshot export feature, TradeFlow captures an image of the currently visible browser tab.
The image is generated locally and saved directly to your Downloads folder. Screenshot data is never uploaded
or transmitted to any server.
</p>

<h2>6. Per-Host State</h2>
<p>
TradeFlow saves checklist progress separately for each website hostname where you activate the overlay
(e.g., your progress on one charting site is independent of another). This hostname information is stored
locally and is never transmitted externally.
</p>

<h2>7. No Tracking or Analytics</h2>
<p>
TradeFlow does not use cookies, pixels, fingerprinting, or any third-party tracking services.
No browsing behavior, usage statistics, or personal information is collected or shared.
All fonts and assets are bundled with the extension — no external resource loading is required.
</p>

<h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
TradeFlow does not sell, transfer, or share user data with third parties for any purpose,
including advertising, analytics, or creditworthiness determination.
</p>

<h2>9. Data Deletion</h2>
<p>
Uninstalling the extension removes all locally stored data. If you have a Pro subscription,
you can manage or cancel it through the Stripe customer portal accessible from the extension's
options page. To request deletion of your billing account, contact the developer.
</p>

<h2>10. Contact</h2>
<p>
If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact the developer through the
<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a> listing.
